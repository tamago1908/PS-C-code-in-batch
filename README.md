# PS-C-code-in-batch
Running multi-line C# code within batch
## Description
This batch is a demo that allows execution of multiple lines of powershell code.
By being able to execute multiple lines of powershell code, it is possible to derive it to execute C# code as well.
This allows C# code to be executed in a single batch without the need for any additional files.

**However, it is recommended to use the latest windows version when executing the code. Older versions of windows may not work.**

It is also not recommended to run the program with administrator privileges granted. In rare cases, antivirus software may falsely detect it as a virus.

Permission is hereby granted to redistribute and/or modify this demo and batch in accordance with LICENSE. Feel free to use them.
